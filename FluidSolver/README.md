# Euler Solver

This is a light-weighted 2nd order finite volume fluid solver for the 2d Euler equation, which is designed for both [education](https://web.stanford.edu/group/frg/course_work/AA214.html) and research purposes. The code supports both steady and unsteady simulations and both explicit and implicit time integrators (In the Jacobian approximation, limiters are neglected, and there is no advanced preconditioners).  


There are two examples
* [Wedge problem](exp/Wedge/Wedge.ipynb): steady simulation of supersonic flow over a wedge, shock wave or rarefaction wave will appear.

* [NACA problem](exp/NACA/NACA.ipynb): steady simulation of transonic flow over a NACA airfoil.
